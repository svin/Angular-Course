1. finish the RestAbstract class.
    - implement PUT
            make sure that you get an ID and show JSON error message if ID not sent to this request
    - implement DELETE
            make sure that you get an ID and show JSON error message if ID not sent to this request
2. why we insist on ID on PUT and DELETE?

3. Build table `users` with the next colums:
    - id [INT,PK,AI]
    - first [varchar(45)]
    - last [varchar(45)]
    - gender [ENUM("MALE","FEMALE")] //google about enum!
    - email [varchar(255)]

4. extend RestAbstract with the class "Users", make sure that all the restfull function works
        //this should add the user
        POST /rest.php?tableName=Users
                    raw data: {"first":"Alon","last":"Nagar","gender":"MALE","email":"Alon.wrk@gmail.com"}

        //should show all the users as dataset
        GET /rest.php?tableName=Users

        //should show user of id 1
        GET /rest.php?tableName=Users&id=1

        // should update the user to be Yael, And Female
        PUT /rest.php?tableName=Users&id=1
            raw data: {"first":"Yael","gender":"FEMALE"}

        // should delete the user
        DELETE /rest.php?tableName=Users&id=1
